# puppy-paradise-website
A very basic website front-end created as part of a course. Its purpose is to showcase information on different dog breeds collected by a famous veterinary.

## Background
This website was created as part of the first semester course at Aptech Institute in Karachi, Pakistan. The goal of the project was to create a site for a fictional client "Patrona", who was a famous veterinary who had collected information on dog breeds from around the world. We only had to create the front-end of the site.

## Site Design
The general look of the site was inspired by the actual site *https://www.dogsindepth.com/*. The site consists of 6 pages;

- A home page
- A gallery of images
- An about page which provides a biography of Dr. Patrona
- Browse All dog breeds
- Browse dog breeds by size
- Browse dog breeds by country of origin

The site also makes use of Bootstrap v.5.1.3 to add carousels and modals. It includes many images of dogs take from various sources, all credit is due to the original creators of the images. This site is not made for profit.
